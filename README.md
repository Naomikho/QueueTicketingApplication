# QueueTicketingApplication
Backend application for queue & ticket system. Built with FastAPI. 
You may use any part of my code as reference, as long as credit is given.

Note: This project is still a work in progress, so the front end is not complete. The backend is already complete, but I am still deploying it.
Edit: GitHubWebPages does not support non-secure connenctions, so you will have to head to my other repository https://github.com/Naomikho/Naomikho.github.io ,download the code in the main branch, and run the React application locally using npm start. The page links are the same(/CustTicket, /CounterView). Only the domain will be different since it's localhost.

How do I access the application?
This repository only contains the backend. Due to time constraints, I did not build a front end from scratched and built new pages as extensions
of my existing website. You can access the application using these two links and open them in two different tabs or devices:

https://naomikho.github.io/CustTicket

https://naomikho.github.io/CounterView
