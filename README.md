# QueueTicketingApplication
Backend application for queue & ticket system. Built with FastAPI. 
You may use any part of my code as reference, as long as credit is given.

Note: This project is still a work in progress. Due to deployment issues WebSocket function is not supported unless both ends of the application run on localhost.

How do I access the application?
This repository only contains the backend. Due to time constraints, I did not build a front end from scratched and built new pages as extensions
of my existing website. You can access the application using these two links and open them in two different tabs or devices:

https://naomikho.github.io/CustTicket

https://naomikho.github.io/CounterView
